            <p>In Guerande, France, salt is still gathered in the same way as it was by the ancient celts, using baskets through which the sea water is strained. 
               This makes the salt very expensive and highly sought after, especially Fleur de Sel (flower of salt).</p>

                Iodized Salt</span>-Iodized salt is a form of table salt which has had iodine added to it to prevent a disease called goiter.​  Goiter is characterized by the swelling of 
                the thyroid gland due to iodine deficiency. Iodine is a nutrient that usually occurs naturally in vegetables, which absorb it from the soil in which they grow. But 
                a diet consisting of food grown in soil that lacks iodine can cause an iodine deficiency, leading to goiter.

            <span class="boldunder">
                Kosher Salt</span>-Kosher salt is a coarse-grained salt that's great for cooking because it's easier to handle than ordinary table salt, and it adheres to food products
                better, too. And since salt is by far the most important seasoning agent in the culinary arts, kosher salt is definitely a cook's best friend.
</p>
        <p>
            <span class="boldunder">
                Pickling Salt</span>-This fine-grained salt has no additives and is generally used in brines to pickle foods. Unlike table salt, the lack of additives will help keep
                the pickling liquid from clouding.
</p>
        <p>
            <span class="boldunder">
                Rock Salt</span>-Less refined and grayish in color, this is the chunky crystal salt used in ice cream machines. This type is generally not used as an edible flavoring mixed
                into foods, but in cooking methods such as to bake potatoes or to encrust or embed meat, seafood or poultry for baking.

            <span class="boldunder">
                Fleur de sel</span>-(pronounced "flure-de-SELL") A rare and expensive form of sea salt that is harvested in parts of France. The name fleur de sel is from the
                French for "flower of salt."  Fleur de sel is produced by a process which involves collecting the thin layer of salt that rises to the surface of shallow pools of seawater
                along the coast of France, mainly but not exclusively in the Brittany region. Similar high-end sea salts are produced in parts of Spain, Portugal and the U.K.

            <span class="boldunder">
                Maldon</span>-Maldon sea salt is cultivated in Essex, England. A favorite of British chefs and cooks everywhere, it has a crisp, bright taste and large, jagged pyramid-shaped crystals
                that make it a nice finishing salt.
</p>
        <p>
            <span class="boldunder">
                Sea Salt</span>-Distilled from sea waters, this form can be fine or coarsely ground.  Some consider sea salt nutritionally better than rock salt because it naturally contains trace minerals,
                but the difference is too minute to note. It does, however, have a stronger and more interesting flavor. Grey or gray salt is a sea salt.

                Himalayan Salt</span>-Salt beds were deposited from ancient oceans 250 million years ago and the ocean layers were uplifted when the Himalayas formed. They were covered by lava and were enveloped in ice and snow for millennia.
                Himalayan salt is chemically similar to table salt plus mineral impurities. It consists of 95–98% sodium chloride, 2–4% polyhalite (potassium, calcium, magnesium, sulfur, oxygen, hydrogen), 0.01% fluoride,
                0.01% iodine, and micro-amounts of numerous trace minerals.  The salt crystals have an off-white to transparent color while impurities in some veins of salt give it a pink, reddish, or beef red color

            <span class="boldunder">
                Black Sea Salt</span>-A unique Hawaiian-inspired sea salt, Hiwa Kai has a stunning black color and silky texture. This all-natural salt offers the same bold flavor and hearty texture as a traditional sea salt, but with an added
                beauty and intrigue that’s indicative of gourmet foods. Using a pure, Optically Clean Pacific sea salt base, Hiwa Kai is created by combining high-quality sea salt with activated charcoal from the shells of coconuts, resulting
                in this unusual seasoning with its rich, dark color & jagged, hard granular texture.
